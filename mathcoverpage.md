# The Euler Identity

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

This elegant equation, known as Euler's Identity, connects five fundamental mathematical constants:
- $e$ (Euler's number)
- $i$ (the imaginary unit)
- $\pi$ (pi)
- 1 (the multiplicative identity)
- 0 (the additive identity)

It's often regarded as one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics, showing a deep connection between exponential functions and trigonometry, as $e^{i\pi} = \cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi) = -1$.
