# [Your Regression Project Title]

## Overview
[Provide a brief overview of your regression project, its purpose, and its significance.]

## Regression Model
Our regression equation is:

[Insert your regression equation here, using LaTeX notation]

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ...$$

Where:
- $Y$ is [explain dependent variable]
- $X_1$, $X_2$, ... are [explain independent variables]
- $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, ... are [explain coefficients]

## Data Sources
Our data comes from the following sources:
1. [Data Source 1]: [Brief description and link if applicable]
2. [Data Source 2]: [Brief description and link if applicable]
3. [Add more as needed]

## Methodology
[Briefly explain your methodology, including:]
- Data cleaning process
- Variable selection method
- Model selection criteria
- Tools and libraries used (e.g., R, Python, statsmodels, scikit-learn)

## Key Findings
[Summarize your main findings. You could include:]
- Significant variables
- R-squared value
- Any surprising or noteworthy results

## Visualizations
[Mention any key visualizations included in the project, such as:]
- Scatter plots
- Residual plots
- Correlation matrices

## Limitations and Future Work
[Discuss any limitations of your current model and potential areas for future research or improvement]

*You could use this section to write down your next steps while you're still working on the project.*

## How to Use This Repository
[Provide instructions on how to navigate your repository, run your code, or reproduce your results]

*This is particularly useful as journals move toward requiring your data and code, but you could remove this section if you're keeping the repo private. That being said, it doesn't hurt to write down instructions for yourself - you may remember what to do now, but will you remember in a year?*
